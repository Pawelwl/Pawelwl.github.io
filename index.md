Stack Overflow runs an Annual Developer Survey every year since 2011. In this article the results of the survey are examined for a subgroup of developers that desribe themselves as being from Data Science field. Five years of data (2018-2022) is analysed.

The survey data and other related details can be found here:
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

By data analysis of the survey results I look for an answer to the following questions:

1. How do Data Scientists work (hybrid / remote / in-person)?
2. What is the education level of Data Scientists and how it has changed over time?
3. How Data Scientist learn to code?
4. How much Data Scientists earn and how much the salaries differ between countries?
5. What are the most popular technologies used?
6. Do mental health problems and accessibility issues affect Data Scientists?
